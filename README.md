# Menu React Project

## Description:

###### Building Restaurant Menu with Filter Buttons to filter each Category.

## What's new thing I learned?

###### Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

## Using of new Set() in project:

###### to generate new object of Categories then spread it into an array with string (all) at first for using this array to build Categories Buttons with Dynamic Approach.
